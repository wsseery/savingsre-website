"""content-rules: the third required check behind content auto-merge.

  content_rules.py <base-sha>

GLOBAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md §8a, on what this PR adds or changes:
  - every new page: exactly one call to action in its copy, the Real estate
    block from 00_Global/LEGAL_DISCLAIMERS.md verbatim, and licence 3333692;
    plus the Insurance block if its copy promotes AlphaGen (GLOBAL §6a);
  - every new or changed page: no figure that is not in the PR body's
    "Sourced figures" table.

Compares the PR's checkout (HEAD) against <base-sha> and looks only at what the
PR changes, so a pre-existing line elsewhere on the site never blocks an
unrelated PR. Exits non-zero on any finding, with every finding listed.

The PR body (for the sourced-figures table) comes from $PR_BODY. Ported from
alphagen-website's content_checks.py `rules` mode; compliance-grep stays in
safety_checks.py.
